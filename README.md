# Support Vector Machine Experiments 
The following repo contains practice with implementing SVMs from scratch. I will attempt to improve my understanding of SVMs by beginning with a basic exhaustive search SVM, then improving on the code as I learn better methods of optimization. 

I will also implement Kernels to allow for non-linear separability of data. 

Exhaustive SVM is simply iterating through all combinations of w, and b, and finding the value that generates the smallest normalization value. 




SGD SVM, uses SGD to solve 'w', by modifying decision boundary with respect to w, and b in order to minimize the hinge loss:

L(0,1-(yi(wxi +b)).
