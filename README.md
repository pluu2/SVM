# Support Vector Machine Experiments 
The following repo contains practice with implementing SVMs from scratch. I will attempt to improve my understanding of SVMs by beginning with a basic exhaustive search SVM, then improving on the code as I learn better methods of optimization. 

I will also implement Kernels to allow for non-linear separability of data. 

## To Do: 
[x] exhaustive SVM 

[ ] SMO SVM 

[ ] Kernel - Polynonmial 

[ ] Kernel - Central Basis Function (Gaussian)
